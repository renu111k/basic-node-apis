Data to be sorted ( 10 GB )
RAM ( 1 GB)
Hard drive ( 240 GB)


Algo:

1. Read 1 GB of the data in main memory and sort it.
2. Write the sorted data to hard drive.
3. Repeat  1 and 2 until all of the data  that is 10 GB is in sorted. We will have total of 10 chunks of sorted data ( 10/1) GB.
4. Read the first 90 MB of each sorted chunk (of 1 GB) into input buffers in and allocate the remaining 100 MB for an output buffer
5. Sort the 10 sorted chunks like merge sort while stroing result the output buffer. If the output buffer fills, write it to the output file and clear it. Whenever any of the 10 input buffers empties, fill it with the next 10 MB of its associated 100 MB sorted chunk until no more data from the chunk is available.
